Preface to Oliver Twist

Regarding Dickens and his art of fiction, I have had some thoughts in my heart for a long time. Taking advantage of writing this preface, I would like to share them with a wide range of Dickens enthusiasts.

Oliver Twist is Dickens' second novel. This 25-year-old novelist is determined to learn from the example of the British realist painter William Hogarth (1697-1764), bravely facing life and vividly portraying the tragic life in the slums of London at that time. He holds a noble moral intention: to protest against social injustice, and to awaken public opinion, promote reforms, and provide assistance to the poor who are in dire straits. Because of this, Dickens has always been defined by scholars in China and the former Soviet Union as the founder and greatest representative of critical realism in British literature. I have some different opinions on this: literature and art are a special social ideology, and they must be a reflection of social existence. However, we must not refer to literature that reflects reality as realism literature, and expand the extension of "realism" infinitely. In fact, the creative methods used by writers are diverse and vary from person to person, which is closely related to their special temperament and personality traits. Dickens' creations are extremely imaginative and full of poetic passion. He deliberately portrays his moral ideals, breaking through the faithful imitation of nature everywhere, borrowing a line from Goethe: it is one layer higher than nature. This is consistent with the objectivity upheld by Thackeray, Trollope, and others. There is a significant difference between a calm and strictly realistic approach.

Taking "Oliver Twist" as an example, (1) Personalized language is an excellent technique used by Dickens in character development. The language of hooligans, thieves, and prostitutes in the book is in line with their identity, and even uses industry slang. However, Dickens never reproduced naturalism, but rather processed, refined, and selected, avoiding the use of obscene and obscene language. The protagonist Oliver has standardized language and elegant speech, and he doesn't even know what theft is. He was an orphan who grew up in a poverty alleviation institution and had never received a good education. He was exposed to people who were burdened with sin and corruption. How could he speak such good English? This cannot be explained by the historical materialist viewpoint that "human beings are the sum of all social relationships". It can be seen that Dickens focused on expressing his moral ideals rather than pursuing complete realism. （2） In excellent realist novels, the plot often revolves around the developmental history of character traits under the influence of the environment, as Gorky referred to it as the "history of a certain personality, typical growth, and composition.". However, Dickens was not bound by any conventions and arranged as many coincidences as he wanted. Oliver went out with a thief for the first time, and the first person to be picked up happened to be his deceased father's friend Brownlow. The second time, he broke into the house and stole under the kidnapping of the bandit Sykes, and it happened to be his own aunt Ruth Mellay's house. This is unreasonable in any case. But Dickens has a great ability to fill specific details with a sense of life and passion, making you gasp for breath when reading. He also has to believe this originally forced and unnatural plot to be true. This is the charm of Dickens' artistic world. （3） When Dickens wrote, he always had a sympathetic imagination, even for heinous characters. The trial of the thief and the old Jewish man Fagin in the book always starts from Fagin's psychological perspective. He looked at the floor from the ceiling and saw his overlapping eyes staring at him. He heard the report on his crime and turned his pleading gaze to the lawyer, hoping to defend him with a few words. Someone was eating in the crowd, someone was fanning with a handkerchief, and a young painter was sketching his drawings. He thought to himself, "I don't know if it looks like it, I really want to stretch my neck to take a look..." A gentleman went out and in again, thinking, "I must have gone to eat. I don't know what kind of food I had."? Seeing sharp spikes on the iron railing, he pondered: it's easy to break. From then on, he thought of the gallows again, and at that moment, he heard himself being hanged. He just murmured that as he grew older, he couldn't make any sound anymore. Here, Dickens carefully selected a series of details, not only depicting objective things, but also delving into the character's inner world, demonstrating his extremely rich imagination. The artistic methods he employs cannot be summarized by critical realism. I do appreciate the expression of British writer and Dickens expert George Gissing (1857-1903), who referred to Dickens' creative method as "romantic realism". I think this statement is accurate enough to fit the reality of Dickens' novel art.

Finally, we also need to discuss the derogatory portrayal of Dickens by E.M. Foster in his masterpiece "A Comprehensive View of Novels". According to him, Dickens only portrayed "flat characters" rather than "round characters", which belongs to a "lower level" in the art of fiction. Is this really the case? Taking Nancy in Oliver Twist as an example, conduct a research and analysis. I believe that the character Nancy has an incredibly rich and complex inner world, far more three-dimensional and vibrant than all the round characters that E.M. Foster admires. Nancy is an unfortunate girl who has been trapped in a thief's den since childhood and has become the mistress of the second thief, Sykes. She couldn't see any other prospects except for the gallows. However, her goodness was still alive, and in the innocent and pure Oliver, seeing her past innocence, her heart was filled with sympathy. She pretended to be Oliver's sister at the behest of the thief, and when she forcibly kidnapped him back to the thief's den, her heart was filled with contradictions. On the way back, she talked to Sykes about hanging prisoners in prison. Oliver felt Nancy's hand trembling as she held onto him tightly. Looking up, her face turned pale. Later, she risked her life to secretly report to Miss Melly and Brownlow, and finally rescued Oliver. Merley and Brownlow urged Nancy to break free from her past life and embark on the path of rebirth, but Nancy couldn't bear to leave her lover Sykes behind. After learning about Nancy's actions, Sykes could only hold onto the moral standards of a thief and regarded her as an unforgivable traitor, cruelly killing her with his own hands. Dickens had a deep intention in naming these two characters. Nancy and Sikes, abbreviated as n and s, are the poles of the magnetic needle. They form a pair of contradictions, both opposing and unified, opposite and complementary, and can never be separated. Nancy couldn't do without Sykes, she would rather be killed by him than abandon him; And Sikes couldn't do without Nancy either. Once he lost her, he would be devastated and finally fall on the roof, his neck caught in the buckle of one of his own ropes, and he died of anger. Nancy's image is complex, rich, and profound, not only not flat, but also achieving extremely high artistic achievements.

Dickens' novels can withstand the exploration and interpretation of various modern critical theories, constantly generating thought-provoking new ideas, and will forever maintain the appreciation interest of readers and the research interest of experts.
